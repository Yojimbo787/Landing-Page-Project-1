# Landing-Page-Project-1
This is my first mini project I have posted on Github. I have made a landing page as a small project and as a way to practice my skills as a web developer. I have used Bootstrap and some CSS in this project.
If there are any suggestions that you want to make please let me know as I want to improve my ability in developing web pages that are of a higher quality eventually. Please note that the landing page is of a fictitious company. 

Many Thanks
